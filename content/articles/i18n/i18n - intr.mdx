Internationalization, or **i18n**, is the process of preparing your application to support multiple languages and regions. In this guide, we'll walk you through how to add i18n to your Next.js project using built-in tools and best practices.

## Why Internationalize?

With a global audience, it's essential to provide users with content in their native language. Next.js simplifies this process with its powerful i18n routing feature.

## Key Features of Next.js i18n

- Built-in support for locale-based routing
- Automatic language detection
- Easy integration with popular libraries like **next-translate** and **react-intl**

## Setting Up i18n in Next.js

To get started, add the i18n configuration in `next.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  i18n: {
    locales: ['en', 'es', 'fr'], // Add your supported languages here
    defaultLocale: 'en',
  },
};
```

This configuration tells Next.js which languages your app supports and what the default language should be.

## Language-Specific Pages

With i18n enabled, your URLs will include locale prefixes (e.g., `/es/about` for the Spanish version of the `/about` page). This ensures users are directed to the correct version of your content.

## Further Learning

For more advanced use-cases, you might want to explore third-party libraries like **next-i18next** for managing translations and language files more effectively.
